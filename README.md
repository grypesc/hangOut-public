## 1. The Motivation For The Project
These days many people spend their time inside the virtual world. Even if we are outside our house we usually 
look at the screen of our smartphone. Instead of making new friends, in reality, we decide to find them on the Internet. 
There is a big possibility that in a few years, humans will completely lose a skill to interact with others in the 
real world. 

I believe that socializing is a basic function of our society. To prevent losing this ability we came up with the idea
for creating a mobile application called HangOut. Its purpose is to simplify making new friends in the real world. 

There are many applications which can help us meet new people. The problem is that the meeting without a particular purpose 
can sometimes be embarrassing. All of us faced a situation in which we just could not find a connection with another person 
and the only thing, that we have been thinking about, was to come back home. To reduce situations like these it might be 
better to keep in mind a common goal while the hangout. Everybody knows that it is easier to get closer to ourselves while 
enjoying an activity. It can be anything, from playing football to smoking a cigarette or working on an interesting project. 

The thing that outstands our application is the possibility of adding a particular context to our meeting. Lets image that 
we are fans of the football. If we would like to play, but we do not have anybody to play with we can just create a proposal 
for the meeting in our app and wait for volunteers. To avoid situations in which we are not able to meet just because of 
commute or accessible time we will be able to specify an approximate time and place for our event. After spending a great 
time with a person that we just met, we can add him to our friends and send messages to keep in touch. 

We believe that doing an activity which we like will always be a pleasure for us. And if we will do it with somebody we 
will enjoy the activity as well as our partner!

## 2. How does it work?
1. Install the application on a smartphone, we created the app installer but it’s not yet on 	Google Play Store             
2. Register / Login (if you use your app frequently you will be logged automatically)
3. Fill your profile (description, profile image)
4. Create or join hangOut
5. Hangout with people in real life, enjoy time and add them as friends for future 	meetings
6. Get a new friend and add him to your app.
7. Keep in touch and meet again in the future! 

## 3. Tools
    • Ubuntu 18, Android – Operating systems used for development
    • JavaScript – a Programming language for both front-end and back-end
    • Atom – Text editor
    • npm –  Package manager
    • git –  version control system
    • Babel.js –  JavaScript compiler
    • Postman –  Testing and debugging the server
    • LibreOffice – Office suite used to create documents and presentations
# Frontend:
    • React Native –  frontend framework
    • Expo –  front-end development environment
    • Android Studio – Android emulation
    • Gimp – Raster graphics editor
# Back-end:
    • Node.js –  server environment
    • Express.js –   server framework
    • MongoDB –  open source database
    • Amazon Web Service – Server where our back-end is deployed and has a public adder.

## 5. Why and what for?
The technology I chose allows to simultaneously develop a project for both IOS and Android systems. I think JavaScript 
React Native will be a top smartphone programming technology in the future, therefore, I decided to learn it. 
What’s more, I abandoned the idea of using the Firebase database and decided to write our own server to make the project 
more complex and learn back-end implementation. The database I chose is also one of the most famous no-SQL databases 
so it is worth to learn it. The project itself is very serious and will be a good addition to my portfolio. 
Please note that all the tools and technologies are open source that will allow me to publish the application in the 
Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.
